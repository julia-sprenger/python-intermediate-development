::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Provide an overview of all the different tools that will be used in this course.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- What tools are needed to collaborate on code development effectively?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The first section of the course is dedicated to setting up your environment for collaborative software development
and introducing the project that we will be working on throughout the course.
In order to build working (research) software efficiently
and to do it in collaboration with others rather than in isolation,
you will have to get comfortable with using a number of different tools interchangeably
as they will make your life a lot easier.
There are many options when it comes to deciding
which software development tools to use for your daily tasks -
we will use a few of them in this course that we believe make a difference.
There are sometimes multiple tools for the job -
we select one to use but mention alternatives too.
As you get more comfortable with different tools and their alternatives,
you will select the one that is right for you based on your personal preferences
or based on what your collaborators are using.

  - Version control and share code: Git & GitHub
  - Write well-written code: PEP8)

Here is an overview of the tools we will be using: VSCode, Python, Git, Unix Shell, Algobank.

## Setup, Common Issues \& Fixes

Have you [setup and installed](../learners/setup.md) all the tools and accounts required for this course?
Check the list of [common issues, fixes \& tips](../learners/common-issues.md)
if you experience any problems running any of the tools you installed -
your issue may be solved there.

### Python Coding Style

Most programming languages will have associated standards and conventions for how the source code
should be formatted and styled.
Although this sounds pedantic,
it is important for maintaining the consistency and readability of code across a project.
Therefore, one should be aware of these guidelines
and adhere to whatever the project you are working on has specified.
In Python, we will be looking at a convention called PEP8.

Let us get started with setting up our software development environment!



:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- In order to develop (write, test, debug, backup) code efficiently, you need to use a number of different tools.
- When there is a choice of tools for a task you will have to decide which tool is right for you, which may be a matter of personal preference or what the team or community you belong to is using.
